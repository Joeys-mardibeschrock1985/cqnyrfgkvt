Wow, just walked out of O'Dessa and I’m still swimming in a haze of whatever just happened. I’m on a bench. There’s popcorn stuck to my jeans, crunchy little annoyances like forgotten promises. Man, does my back hurt.

The opening was this whirlwind, like being caught in a tornado of colors — blues and reds, or maybe green? The plot twisted like a pretzel, except with less salt and more sugar. The lead was this guy who had eyes like an owl — you know, wide and sort of judgmental, and he kept saying things that felt significant, or maybe they were just gibberish? Sometimes I think I’m watching a dream, not a movie. It makes sense when it doesn't.

> I just remembered someone told me to download the movie, but they should totally just go to the theater. The speakers were so loud you could feel the bass in your teeth, like chewing on a speaker wire. And the lady next to me kept checking her phone, the light flickering like a moth caught indoors.

Gotta tell you about the scene where they... wait, I don’t even know what they were doing. Something with a cat? Or maybe it was a metaphor for life being unpredictable like a box of tangled earphones. Ugh, still keep finding popcorn, like I’m some kind of crunchy archeologist.

The score was, um, reminiscent of a... a washing machine remixed with Beethoven? Yeah, that sounds right. Or maybe it was more like Beethoven crashing a dinner party with a blender. Not sure if I’m making sense but, whatever, my brain is still a scrambled egg from that whole finale chase scene. Like, where were they even going? An existential goose chase... with lasers. Honestly, I'd recommend ppl to just watch the movie for that bit alone.

The ending... oh man, the ending. Like the writer lost their script pages, but in a beautifully tragic way. Suddenly it hits you, maybe it wasn’t about the destination but the journey, and isn’t that some sort of cliche or what? Hah, what even is cliche at this point. More popcorn on my pants, great.

Geez, if you’re gonna to see it, bring aspirin. Trust me. And maybe a notepad for the quotes, or maybe scratch that — they might just mess with your head more. Okay, I'm rambling, am I finished? I think I am.
